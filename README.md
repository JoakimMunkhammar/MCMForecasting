This repository contains codes for training the MCM model and generating samples. It includes:

1. MCMFit - Fitting the MCM model to training data
2. MCMForecastSample - Sample from a fitted MCM model
3. MCMExampleSample - Example code for fitting and sampling from the MCM model

It also contains both Uniform and Empirical Probability Denstity Distribution (EPDF) setting.
